Welcome to my case study.

About the result:
I was able to achieve a rendering of the sports nutrition category with basic product filters. Each product sends the user to the main product page.
As for filtering, all filters filter products by the selected value (And also the price filter, although it has certain errors in operation, but reloading the page solves the problem of price selection). It is also possible to remove the filter by clicking on the button 'Vyma≈æ filtre' or on the filter of the selected category.
Glad to present you my result, enjoy :)
